# Project Description ðŸ”°

In this project we have implemented first two phases of a compiler i.e. Lexical Analyzer and Parser. Lexical Analyzer's job is to read a source program and generate a token stream which is then read by a parser to validate the sequence of tokens and report any syntax errors. We used `Flex` and `Yacc` to generate the Lexical Analyzer and Parser.
